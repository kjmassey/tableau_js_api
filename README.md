# Tableau Viz Portal using the JavaScript API
This is the scaffolding of a hypothetical BI visualization portal using the Tableau JavaScript API!

The intention of this repo is to augment/complement the #TableauCoders initiative (#TCI) user group. We realize that some our audience aren't quite pros, but aren't newbies either - and they're looking for real-world examples, right now!

This is the first in a series of side-projects I hope to share with all of you, and I would love for this to become a community project/open forum/jam session on coding questions, concerns, feedback and gripes about Tableau for those of us *already* in the thick of it! Please feel free to enagage both me and Zak here on github, on Twitter, or via email!

As of **3/22/22**, this mock portal includes:
- Embedded viz(zes)
- Switch between vizzes in same part of DOM
- Interacting with parameters/filters by name, w/ logic based on current value(s)
  - onClick
  - onChange (form > select)

Open functionality opportunities:
- Reset all (all, filters, params, etc.)
- Populate/use data from sheet/mark on page
- Transform data based on user input
- **Your ideas!**
